# Project Name: Quant Analysis on NYC's Daily Inmates in Custody
## Group Name: 
Sleep-Narwhal
## Project Description: 

Analyzed NYC inmate custody data to explore demographic disparities in security classification and the relationship between mental health observation and infractions using interactive visualizations.

## Setup & Usage
*Setup*

Ensure Python 3 is installed.
Install required Python packages:
Download or clone the project repository and confirm that main.ipynb is located in the project root directory.

*Usage*

Open the notebook:
<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/advanced-computing/sleepy-narwhal/blob/main/main.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

Run the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom.
The notebook will:
1. Load and clean the NYC Daily Inmates in Custody dataset
2. Generate descriptive statistics for inmate demographics
3. Produce an interactive stacked bar chart showing custody level distribution by race and age
4. Explore the relationship between mental health observation status and recorded infractions
5. All visualizations and outputs are generated directly within the notebook; no external configuration is required.
